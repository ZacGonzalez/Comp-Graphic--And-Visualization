How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

 When designing software, I like to envision what I need my software to do. This course utilized c++, a very robust and useful programming language. When going through the walkthroughs, I learned how to place my code with proper spacing and labeling. Learning how to orient my code this way can help in any future projects I take part in.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
   I utilized iteration a lot when developing my 3D scene. We were assigned to create a 3D scene based off a 2D image. To create the shapes, I had to draw triangles using coordinates. Once I figured out how to draw one shape, I created more shapes using the same method. After a while, I had generated the full 3D scene! Throughout this course, I loved being able to work towards the final each week, adding in the code from each milestone. This made the final project easier to work on.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
  From both an educational and a professional standpoint, the material I learned in this course can be very helpful. As I stated above, the knowledge of c++ can be extremely helpful as it is a very popular language. Also, the knowledge I obtained on how to generate 3D structures, will help me on any graphic or visualization projects I work on educationally and professionally.
